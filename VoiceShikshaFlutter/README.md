## üìä Features in Detail

### Voice Recording & Analysis

```dart
// Start recording
await _audioService.startRecording(letterName);

// Stop recording and analyze
final recordingPath = await _audioService.stopRecording();
final result = await _analysisService.analyzePronunciation(
  audioFilePath: recordingPath,
  targetLetter: targetLetter,
);
```

### Progress Tracking

- Individual letter scores and attempts
- Overall performance metrics
- Achievement system
- Learning streak tracking

### Responsive Design

The app adapts to different screen sizes and orientations:

- Flexible layouts using `Expanded` and `Flexible`
- Responsive text sizing with `clamp()`
- Adaptive grid layouts for various devices

## üîß Development

### Adding New Letters

1. Update `lib/models/letter.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const List<Letter> hindiVowels = [
     Letter(
       character: "‡§Ö",
       hint: 'Say "A" like in "Apple"',
       pronunciation: "A",
       audioFile: "A.wav",
     ),
     // Add new letters here
   ];
   ```

2. Add corresponding audio files to backend

### Adding New Screens

1. Create screen file in `lib/screens/`
2. Import and add navigation in `home_screen.dart`
3. Update routing if using named routes

## üß™ Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
flutter test
```

For widget testing, see examples in `test/` directory.

## üì¶ Building

### Debug Build
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

### Release Build
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Install on Device
```bash
flutter install
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server Connection Failed**:
   - Ensure Flask server is running on `localhost:5000`
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify server URL in `pronunciation_service.dart`

2. **Recording Permission Denied**:
   - Grant microphone permission in device settings
   - Check `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` permissions

3. **Audio Analysis Failed**:
   - Verify audio file format (WAV expected)
   - Check server logs for processing errors
   - Ensure target letter exists in CSV dataset

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in `main.dart`:

```dart
void main() {
  if (kDebugMode) {
    print('Debug mode enabled');
  }
  runApp(const VoiceShikshaApp());
}
```
